# Plasma-Research

Python codes used for processing plasma density data from Hermes-3 simulations.
Azimuthal, axial, and radial profiles show how the electron density is distributed over each axis.
Timeseries data shows how the electron density changes over time.
FFT (Fast-Fourier Transforms) analyzes timeseries data to provide frequencies and amplitudes of the density, which is used to calculate turbulence.
